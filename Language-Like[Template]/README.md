The Language-Like[Template] is a LaTeX template that I created in 2015 in order to give my articles a nice look.
I also wanted to explore how to get into the more stylistic side of LaTeX.

Documents produced using this template bear a superficial resemblance to those in the journal Language.
Two notable differences are the inclusion of keywords after the abstract---which Language does not have---and some general issues with the references, notably that author names are not in small caps.
I would like to change to appearance of the references at some point, but that probably won't be any time soon.

I know that I borrowed many ideas from sources I was able to find online, but as I write this in 2020, I cannot remember the origins. 
I am, nonetheless, grateful for their help.
