@article{Clopper2005,
	Abstract = {The identification of the gender of an unfamiliar talker is an easy and automatic process for na{\"{i}}ve adult listeners. Sociolinguistic research has consistently revealed gender differences in the production of linguistic variables. Research on the perception of dialect variation, however, has been limited almost exclusively to male talkers. In the present study, na{\"{i}}ve participants were asked to categorize unfamiliar talkers by dialect using sentence-length utterances under three presentation conditions: male talkers only, female talkers only, and a mixed gender condition. The results revealed no significant differences in categorization performance across the three presentation conditions. However, a clustering analysis of the listeners' categorization errors revealed significant effects of talker gender on the underlying perceptual similarity spaces. The present findings suggest that na{\"{i}}ve listeners are sensitive to gender differences in speech production and are able to use those differences to reliably categorize unfamiliar male and female talkers by dialect.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual and acoustic research on dialect variation in the United States requires an appropriate corpus of spoken language materials. Existing speech corpora that include dialect variation are limited by poor recording quality, small numbers of talkers, and/or small samples of speech from each talker. The Nationwide Speech Project corpus was designed to contain a large amount of speech produced by male and female talkers representing the primary regional varieties of American English. Five male and five female talkers from each of six dialect regions in the United States were recorded reading words, sentences, passages, and in interviews with an experimenter, using high quality digital recording equipment in a sound-attenuated booth. The resulting corpus contains nearly an hour of speech from each of the 60 talkers that can be used in future research on the perception and production of dialect variation. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Different speakers may pronounce the same sounds very differently, yet listeners have little difficulty perceiving speech accurately. Recent research suggests that listeners adjust their preexisting phonemic categories to accommodate speakers' pronunciations (perceptual learning). In some cases, these adjustments appear to reflect general changes to phonemic categories, rather than speaker-specific adjustments. But what happens when listeners encounter multiple speakers with different pronunciations? We exposed listeners to two speakers who varied in their pronunciation of a particular phoneme (Experiment 1: /d/ or /t/; Experiment 2: /s/ or /ʃ/). Listeners then categorized sounds on /d/-/t/ or /s/-/ʃ/ continua, in the same two voices. The results suggest that perceptual experience leads to very different learning for different types of phonemic contrasts. For fricatives, perceptual learning was speaker-specific: The system was able to maintain multiple different representations simultaneously. In contrast, perceptual learning for stop consonants resulted in more general changes that required the system to re-adjust when a new pronunciation was encountered.},

	Abstract = {Listeners are faced with enormous variation in pronunciation, yet they rarely have difficulty understanding speech. Although much research has been devoted to figuring out how listeners deal with variability, virtually none (outside of sociolinguistics) has focused on the source of the variation itself. The current experiments explore whether different kinds of variation lead to different cognitive and behavioral adjustments. Specifically, we compare adjustments to the same acoustic consequence when it is due to context-independent variation (resulting from articulatory properties unique to a speaker) versus context-conditioned variation (resulting from common articulatory properties of speakers who share a dialect). The contrasting results for these two cases show that the source of a particular acoustic-phonetic variation affects how that variation is handled by the perceptual system. We also show that changes in perceptual representations do not necessarily lead to changes in production. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{VanBerkum2008,
	Abstract = {When do listeners take into account who the speaker is? We asked people to listen to utterances whose content sometimes did not match inferences based on the identity of the speaker (e.g., "If only I looked like Britney Spears" in a male voice, or "I have a large tattoo on my back" spoken with an upper-class accent). Event-related brain responses revealed that the speaker's identity is taken into account as early as 200-300 msec after the beginning of a spoken word, and is processed by the same early interpretation mechanism that constructs sentence meaning based on just the words. This finding is difficult to reconcile with standard "Gricean" models of sentence interpretation in which comprehenders initially compute a local, context-independent meaning for the sentence ("semantics") before working out what it really means given the wider communicative context and the particular speaker ("pragmatics"). Because the observed brain response hinges on voice-based and usually stereotype-dependent inferences about the speaker, it also shows that listeners rapidly classify speakers on the basis of their voices and bring the associated social stereotypes to bear on what is being said. According to our event-related potential results, language comprehension takes very rapid account of the social context, and the construction of meaning based on language alone cannot be separated from the social aspects of language use. The linguistic brain relates the message to the speaker immediately.},

In the 1930s, the term General American was advanced by writers and scholars who had both general and special interests in the regional varieties of American English. The interest in American English in Germany after the Second World War saw the term also used there in treatises on American speech. The dictionaries that have appeared in the 1960s have taken differing attitudes toward the term, most defining it in the body of the work, but usually leaving it out of the introductory discussion. General American may have lost the regional boundaries which it acquired after Krapp set it loose, it nonetheless has gained the supra-regional status which he thought it to have, but at present recognized in a professional dialect which is acquired through special schooling by many of its users, whereby they receive instruction and practice in how to talk alike.},

	Abstract = {Previous research by speech scientists on the acoustic characteristics of American English vowel
systems has typically focused on a single regional variety, despite decades of sociolinguistic
research demonstrating the extent of regional phonological variation in the United States. In the
present study, acoustic measures of duration and first and second formant frequencies were obtained
from five repetitions of 11 different vowels produced by 48 talkers representing both genders and six
regional varieties of American English. Results revealed consistent variation due to region of origin,
particularly with respect to the production of low vowels and high back vowels. The Northern
talkers produced shifted low vowels consistent with the Northern Cities Chain Shift, the Southern
talkers produced fronted back vowels consistent with the Southern Vowel Shift, and the New
England, Midland, and Western talkers produced the low back vowel merger. These findings
indicate that the vowel systems of American English are better characterized in terms of the region
of origin of the talkers than in terms of a single set of idealized acoustic-phonetic baselines of
``General'' American English and provide benchmark data for six regional varieties.},

In this paper, the theory is extended to model speech production as well as speech perception. Straightforward extension of the model provides a formal framework for thinking about the quantitative predictions of usage-based phonology, as proposed by Bybee. A model is proposed which allows us to derive the finding that leniting historical changes are more advanced in frequent words than in rarer ones. Calculations using this model are presented which reveal the interaction of production noise, lenition and entrenchment. A realistic treatment is also provided for the time course of a phonological merger which originates from lenition of a marked category.},

Independent variables were number of intervening words (lag) between initial and subsequent presentations of a word, total number of talkers in the stimulus set, and whether words were repeated in the same voice or a different voice. In Experiment 1, recognition judgements were based on word identity alone. Same-voice repetitions were recognized more quickly and accurately than different-voice repetitions at all values of lag and at all levels of talker variability. In Experiment 2, recognition judgments were based on both word identity and voice identity. Subjects recognized repeated voices quite accurately. Gender of the talker affected voice recognition but not item recognition. These results suggest that detailed information about a talker's voice is retained in long-term episodic memory representations of spoken words.},

@article{Port2010a,
	Abstract = {It is claimed here that experimental evidence about human speech processing and the richness of memory for linguistic material supports a distributed view of language where every speaker creates an idiosyncratic perspective on the linguistic conventions of the community. In such a system, words are not spelled in memory of speakers from uniform letter-like units (whether phones or phonemes), but rather from the rich auditory patterns of speech plus any coupled visual, somatosensory and motor patterns. The evidence is strong that people actually employ high-dimensional, spectro-temporal, auditory patterns to support speech production, speech perception and linguistic memory in real time. Abstract phonology (with its phonemes, distinctive features, syllable types, etc.) is actually a kind of social institution - a loose inventory of patterns that evolves over historical time in each human community as a structure with many symmetries and regularities in the community corpus. Linguistics studies the phonological (and grammatical) patterns of various communities of speakers. But linguists should not expect to find the descriptions they make to be explicitly represented in any individual speaker's mind, much less in every mind in the community. The alphabet is actually a technology that has imposed itself on our understanding of language. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This work challenges the traditional assumption that phonological variables are categorical in nature. Variationists typically investigate the social and linguistic factors that condition the use of particular categories of variant, often ignoring the considerable phonetic variation within categories. I argue here that phonetic details play a central role in constructing social meaning and that they can also participate in the linguistic motivation of variation. Phonological variables can vary along a host of phonetic dimensions, dimensions that can be manipulated to intensify meaning onto create new meanings.

Recent approaches to variation view linguistic features not as markers of social categories but rather as symbolic resources that encode the meanings from which social categories are derived. Following such approaches, I propose a theoretical framework for analyzing the link between linguistic forms and their social meanings. The framework is applied to phonetic and phonological variation patterns in the speech of three gay professionals as they move from one situation to another.

The question of whether phonetic detail matters permeates the analysis, and to show that the significance of phonetic detail is broad, I examine variation at three levels of representation: the segmental level (realization of word-final coronal stops), the prosodic level (intonational variation in declaratives), and voice quality (falsetto phonation). Robust and socially meaningful patterns of phonetic variation emerge for all three variables, often in the absence of patterned categorical variation.

The dissertation concludes by bringing the three variables together, along with their proposed social meanings, to consider how they are assembled to construct styles. It is suggested that while individual linguistic features index vague meanings on their own, the meaning of sets of features is considerably more vivid.

This work illustrates that an approach taking into account the phonetic details of variation can bring to the surface a rich palate of meanings that cannot be accessed by categorical investigations alone. If one of the goals of variation studies is to investigate the construction of social meaning, the scope of traditional approaches must expand to incorporate more phonetic axes of variation.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this research is to determine to what extent listeners use social information about a speaker in constructing phonological space. The main hypotheses are the following: (1) listeners use social information to calibrate the phonological space of speakers; (2) stereotypes about given language varieties effect the way in which listeners calibrate the phonological space of speakers of those varieties; and (3) people's stereotypes about their own variety can be inaccurate, and that the phonological space calibrated for members of their own speech communities reflects this inaccuracy.

Forty-one Detroit-area residents were given perceptual tests in which they were asked to choose from a set of resynthesized vowels the tokens that they felt best-matched the vowels they heard in the speech of a fellow Detroiter. Half of the respondents were told that the speaker was from Detroit, while half were told that she was from Windsor, Ontario, Canada, which is directly across the Detroit River from Detroit. A language attitudes survey in Detroit had indicated that Detroiters stereotype Canadian speech, particularly with regard to the raised dipthong as in the phrase 'aboot the hoose.' Nevertheless, acoustic analysis of Detroiters' speech indicated that this raised diphthong is present in the speech of many Detroiters.

Both groups of respondents heard the same Detroit female speaker on the test tape. However, respondents given the CANADIAN label chose the raised-diphthong tokens as those present in the dialect of the speaker, while those given the MICHIGAN label did not choose raised diphthongs.

Respondents given the MICHIGAN label also chose vowels that corresponded to Standard American vowels, despite the fact that the Northern Cities Chain Shift has drastically shifted the vowels of Detroit speakers away from such a canonical system.

Since the "speaker's" nationality was the only aspect of the test that varied between the two groups of respondents, this label alone must have caused the difference in the selection of tokens. This indicates that listeners do indeed use social information in the perception of speech.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the structure of sociolinguistic variation requires understanding what information it coveys to listeners and how. Variation not only correlates with social structures but carries social meaning, influencing listener perceptions and through them social structures. This research demonstrates that listeners' interpretations of the English variable (ING) (working/workin') hadepends on contextual factors and its correlates interact with each other perceptually.

The study employs the Matched Guise Technique, using digitally manipulated stimuli differing only in tokens of (ING). The stimuli were created from spontaneous speech from eight speakers, two men and two women each from the South and the West Coast. Listener reactions to the manipulated recordings were collected in two phases. Group interviews (N = 60) provided open-ended information regarding the recordings generally and listener ideologies about (ING). This data was used to construct a survey (N = 124) to collect more structured responses.

The findings show that (ING) is connected to a network of social meanings, including education, articulateness, formality, region and the rural/urban divide. Overall, speakers were rated as more educated and more likely to be articulate when they used -ing . The data also show that variation-based social meaning is not compositional but instead the impact of a variable depends on its context. Regional accents triggered expectations regarding (ING) use and meaning, which influenced the impact of actual uses. (ING) shifted the relationship between pairs of meanings, such as masculinity and intelligence or socioeconomic class and formality. Finally, listeners showed agency selecting what cues to attend to and how to interpret them. The effect of (ING) depended, among other things, on the positive or negative reaction of the listener. Using - ing could make a speaker sound more intelligent to some while making others think only that the speaker is trying to sound more intelligent.

These results show that variation does influence listener perceptions, i.e. carries social meanings. These meanings, however, are not static. To understand their structure, a fully developed theory of style is needed, explaining not only how variation contributes to larger impressions, but also how overall impressions influence the contribution of a single variable.},

@mastersthesis{Jeon2012,
	Abstract = {Perceptual dialectology studies have shown that people have strong opinions about the number and placement of dialect regions. There has been relatively little research conducted in this area on Korean, however, with early studies using only short language attitude surveys. The present study uses the `draw-a-map' task to examine perceptions of language variation in Korea. Respondents were asked to draw a line around places in Korea where people speak differently and provide names, examples, and comments about the language spoken in those areas. These data were aggregated and analyzed with ArcGIS 10.0 software and using the `keywords' method. An analysis of these data suggest that Koreans' perceptions of dialect regions are not necessarily limited by administrative boundaries; in fact, the data reveal not only perceptions of dialect variation unassociated with geographic borders, but also taps into the way people connect ideas about language and place. Results from this study have implications for language attitudes research, perceptual dialectology methodology, and understanding the relationship between language and place in Korea.},

@article{Lameli2008,
	Abstract = {Within the context of investigations of cognitive spatial models, the study analyzes the effect of varying the informational structure of linguistic survey instruments. A group of informants was asked to draw German language areas on different types of geographic maps. First, in a quantitative approach we show how the specific informational structure of each map type influences the frequency and prominence of the named language areas. The second part of the study focuses on the localization of the mentioned language areas. Here we discuss the specific effects of each type of map and the information it contains on the localization. We also discuss general characteristics of the conceptualization of linguistic space as well as differences in the perception of the prominent language areas.},

It also allows examination of the underlying factors in dialect use such as the „beliefs, attitudes and strategies`` (Preston, 1999: xxiii) which make up language users`` reactions to language varieties. In this way it has the potential to ask questions of identity and explore the reasons for dialect loyalty as well as complementing other research in the field of language variation and change.

What do non-specialists in linguistics think about dialects and their speakers? What cognitive maps do they have of these dialects? What attitudes do they have towards the dialects and their speakers? Do non-specialists in linguistics associate particular features with the dialects or perceive them in a special way?

@article{Montgomery2013,
	Abstract = {This article presents a new method for processing data gathered using the ``draw-a-map'' task in perceptual dialectology (PD) studies. Such tasks produce large numbers of maps containing many lines indicating nonlinguists' perceptions of the location and extent of dialect areas. Although individual maps are interesting, and numerical data relating to the relative prominence of dialect areas can be extracted, an important value of the draw-a-map task is in aggregating data. This was always an aim of the contemporary PD method, although the nature of the data has meant that this has not always been possible. Here, we argue for the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in order to aggregate, process, and display PD data. Using case studies from the United Kingdom and Germany, we present examples of data processed using GIS and illustrate the future possibilities for the use of GIS in PD research.},
